                            Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the
                            representation of information from the user's interaction with it. The model consists
                            of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view can be any output
                            representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same
                            data are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
                            The controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view.The
                            central ideas behind MVC are code reusability and n addition to dividing the application
                            into three kinds of components, the MVC design defines the interactions between
                            them.

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>A controller </b>can send commands to its associated view to change the view's
                                presentation of the model (e.g., by scrolling through a document). It can also send
                                commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document).
                            </li>
                            <li><b>A model</b> notifies its associated views and controllers when there has been
                                a change in its state. This notification allows the views to produce updated output,
                                and the controllers to change the available set of commands. A passive implementation
                                of MVC omits these notifications, because the application does not require them
                                or the software platform does not support them. </li>
                            <li><b>A view</b> requests from the model the information that it needs to generate
                                an output representation to the user. </li>
                        </ul>
